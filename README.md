# companies-that-mentor-juniors-in-tech


## Background
I wrote a tweet (see https://twitter.com/runhappylife/status/1113772742036348928) that generated a ton of useful links that I wanted to share as a resource for all people looking to get their start in Tech as a software developer, web developer, front and back end developer, etc. Also, those looking for product and UI/UX designer roles are included too!

## Who is this for?
This not just for people who are looking to make their start in their IT career. It is also for people who are mid-level/senior and have spent years in the IT industry honing their craft and want to pass on their knowledge as mentors to support the next generation of people coming into Tech. Without these mentors, junior developers will not get the support they need to grow and become better developers. 

## What about Interns?
There is no reason why you cannot use this list to find an internship! Check the listings, you might find something that is a good fit for you!

## Any remote positions? 
This question will inevitably come up. I have not filtered this list to identify remote positions. It is best to check with the company yourself and see if they are open to remote. You never know, they might accept remote but be aware it is rare to get junior remote roles. It is easier to mentor if you are physically in the office and you get the full benefit of a mentoring program. 

## Word of Advice 
I have put in a lot of time to put this list together to share with you however given the length of the list I cannot personally vet each company to verify that each company does support and develop junior roles with mentoring. I am relying on the goodness and honesty of each person that responded to my tweet to tell me about these companies to put them on the list. Please do your own research into the company you are considering applying for and ensure it is a good fit for your needs. 

## Can you help?
Glad you asked! If you found this resource useful or found a job through this list and found the company true to their word in providing mentoring to juniors then I'd love to hear from you. If you know of a company that is not on this list and you know they provide mentoring to juniors please do let me know at https://twitter.com/runhappylife?lang=en on Twitter! Alternatively if you know or work for a company that is not providing mentoring and is on this list, please do let me know do I can remove it. I would like to maintain the integrity of this list, keep it relevant and up to date however I need your support to do this.
